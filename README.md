# BlackJack
 This is a responsive BlackJack game. 
 To use, simply download the src Folder to a new project folder and compile the 'Main.java' file.
 Alternatively, you could just copy the .java files and compile them however you'd like, however make sure the pictures are still accessible.
 The easiest way I've found to do it is to download as zip and set first folder as workspace, and import the second as existing project
